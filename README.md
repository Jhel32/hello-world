practicing git-hub flow

readme-edits
I am new to Github dated September 15, 2024 Sunday 1:03am.
I am a new programmer. I know the basics of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, Linux, currently learning PHP.
I started programming back in 2006. My first program is called Turbo C in the Philippines.
I am from the Philippines. It's a blue screen where you add codes. Similar to the airport terminal machines.
I always wonder how Git works. This is pretty interesting as a starter. 
Join me in this journey of self-discovery and creativity.
